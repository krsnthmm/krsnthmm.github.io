                <p>having evolved in japan over seven centuries, <i>ikebana</i> is the art of arranging different flower parts in vases and other containers. in order to convey one's expressions through ikebana, they need to develop technical skills like fastening and positioning flowers in different ways. even if we become proficient in these skills, can we really say we understand what ikebana is?</p>

                <b>1. possible origins</b>
            </button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>while its actual origins are unknown, ikebana is thought to have come to japan as part of buddhist practice. there are also others who say that from pre-buddhist times, evergeen trees and flowers were used to invoke nature guards, with this practice being claimed to be at the heart of secular ikebana.</p>
                <br>
                <p>regardless of its true origins, it is clear even in the earliest of japanese writings that japan has a deep affinity with nature in the form of flowers, wild plants, and trees.</p>

                <b>2. early periods </b>
            </button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>the first appearance of ikebana as we know it was in the muromachi period (late-14th to mid-16th century). during this period, much of what eventually became considered traditional japanese art and its principles of beauty were established. this was the period when the shoin-style of ikebana emerged. </p>
                <br>
                <p>however, the flowering of ikebana in popular culture was not unplanned. groups of artists (doboshu) were given responsibility for aesthetics and techniques by the daimyo (feudal lords) and shoguns (generals). some doboshu focused on flower arrangement, eventually producing a style based on a standing branch in the center of the vase, known as tatebana. afterwards, masters of flower arrangement began emerging in succession. from the azuchi momoyama period through the edo period, ikebana changed with the times.</p>

                <b>3. changes and modernisation</b>
            </button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>one of ikebana's major shifts happened in the edo period. the ikenobo style of tatebana jumped from the samurai warrior class to townsman or urban merchant culture and changed its name to rikka, having been influenced by senno rikkyu's chabana (simplified flower arrangements for tea rooms). rikka's creative impulse eventually faded, with its geometric effect lost in decorative complications, thus giving way to a new highly symbolic style called seika (also known as shoka). seika was based on a triangular framework, with its main principle being heaven-earth-mankind. many new schools opened to teach this style, thus introducing the iemoto system.</p>
                <br>
                <p>with the meiji period modernisation, the meiji government had committed itself to educating women, later deciding that ikebana should be defined as training women to be "good wives and mothers". this led to ikebana, once a male art form, becoming a standard part of women's education, and established the basis for ikebana's revival, as well as allowed ikebana to become a practice open to women, though women were forbidden almost by law to innovate in any major way.</p>
                <br>
                <p>in the late 19th century, when people began growing western plants, a style called moribana was popularized by ohara unshin. this style was used for the new western flowers in ikebana arrangement.</p>

                <h2>arrangement elements</h2>
                <p>ikebana flower arrangements are mostly known for their minimalist aesthetic. in an ikebana flower arrangement, equal emphasis is put on the three main elements that make up the arrangement: <b>mass</b>, <b>colour</b> and <b>line</b>.</p>
                <br>
                <p>all three elements do not always have to be present in ikebana arrangements. sometimes you might consider emphasising one element and showcasing its beauty. ikebana is about balancing the elements and using them effectively to create arrangements that express the artist's thoughts and emotions.</p>

            <h2>mass</h2>
            <p>
                mass in ikebana is a somewhat controversial topic: on one hand it may not be considered ikebana due to the similarity in appearance to western arrangements, and on the other constructing a proper mass can be rather difficult.<br><br>
                while flowers are a primary material in ikebana arrangements, they are not the only material that can be used for construction mass. mass in ikebana arrangements can be made using leaves, twigs, artificial objects, paper, etc. to help enhance the arrangement.<br><br>

        <div class="elem" id="elem2">
            <h2>colour</h2>
            <p>
                colour in ikebana can be used in several different ways in arrangements, such as using a single colour, using a tonal range (e.g. red, orange and yellow), or using contrasting/complementary colours(e.g. yellow and blue/violet).<br><br>
                different colour arrangements work for different situations. if you want an ikebana arrangement to be the focal point of a room, the contrast arrangement works perfectly for that. however, if you want to start in a safer territory or if you just want something relaxing and easy on the eyes, a single tonal range arrangement would work best.<br><br>
                click on the image above to learn about <b>lines</b> in ikebana!

        <div class="elem" id="elem3">
            <h2>line</h2>
            <p>
                there are different types of lines that can be used in arrangements, including the natural curves of branches, the straight lines of reed and bamboo, and the curled stems of flowers.<br><br>
                an arrangement can be made more eye-catching even with just a single strong line added in. bold lines and a minimal number of flowers can create a dramatic impact on the space where the arrangement is displayed.<br><br>

                    <p>the most basic structure in ikebana, <i>moribana</i> literally means "piled-up flowers". the flowers are arranged in a shallow container such as a <i>suiban</i>. a compote or a basket.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>moribana</i> gets its name from arrangements in wide-mouthed, shallow containers suggesting that the arrangement is a serving (<i>moru</i> in japanese means "to serve up"). these arrangements are secured on <i>kenzan</i>/needlepoint holder(s), also known as metal frogs.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p><i>nageire</i> literally translates to "tossed-in flowers", and flowers arranged this way are usually arranged in a narrow-mouthed, tall container without using <i>kenzan</i>. <i>nageire</i> uses plant materials in their natural state, in containers such as those made of bamboo, or in water pitchers. the flowers are secured in simple devices made and fitted to either the material or the container.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>cutting a garden flower and placing it in a cup is also considered <i>nageire</i>. <i>nageire</i> can therefore start with one-flower arrangements such as these.</p>
